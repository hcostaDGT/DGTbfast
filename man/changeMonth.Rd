\usage{
changeMonth(change, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link{writeRaster}}}

\item{change.}{RasterLayer representing pixel breakpoints extracted from \code{\link{bfmSpatial}} output.}
}
\value{
either a RasterLayer with values between 1 to 12 (representing month of change), or if multiple years are represented in the input change RasterLayer, a RasterBrick with one layer for each year, and values of 1 to 12 representing change months for each year.
}
\description{
Returns one RasterLayer for each year represented by the change results. Months are represted by integers from 1 to 12.
